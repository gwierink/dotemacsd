* Emacs install notes
*** What is this?
    + Just a bunch of notes-to-self to get up and running with Emacs on a new
      install.
* MELPA
  + Note that you'll need to run M-x package-refresh-contents or
    M-x package-list-packages to ensure that Emacs has fetched the MELPA package 
    list before you can install packages with M-x package-install or similar. 
  + Add packages:
      ac-c-headers
      company
      company-c-headers
      company-irony
      company-irony-c-headers
      auto-complete
      auto-complete-c-headers
      org
* Trouble
*** Symbol's value as variable is void: user-emacs-working-directory
    + Having problems reading the init files correctly, have not yet found a
    cure.
